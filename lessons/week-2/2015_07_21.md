## Model-View-Controller || MVC  
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/MVC.html  

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern assigns *objects* in an application one of three roles: **model**, **view**, or **controller**.

#### Model
Model objects encapsulate the data specific to an application and *define the logic and computation that manipulate and process that data*. For example, a model object might represent a character in a game or a contact in an address book.

#### View
A view object is an object in an application that users can see. A view object *knows how to draw itself and can respond to user actions*.

#### Controller
A controller object acts as an intermediary between one or more of an applicationâ€™s view objects and one or more of its model objects. Controller objects *are thus a conduit through which view objects learn about changes in model objects and vice versa*.
