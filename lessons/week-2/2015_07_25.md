# Objective
* Understand the use case of a UITableViewController
* Ability to implement a UITableView with static UITableViewCells

### View controller lifecycle

**- loadView**  
*Creates the view that the controller manages.*
> It’s only called when the view controller is created and only when done programatically. You can override this method in order to create your views manually.  

**- viewDidLoad**  
*Called after the controller’s view is loaded into memory.*
> It’s only called when the view is created. Keep in mind that in this lifecycle step the view bounds are not final. Good place to **init** and **setup** objects used in the viewController.

**- viewWillAppear:**  
> It’s called whenever the view is presented on the screen. In this step the view has bounds defined but **the orientation is not applied**. This event is called every time the view appears so don’t add code here which should be executed just one time (or manage it correctly).

**- viewWillLayoutSubviews**  
> This method is called every time the frame changes like for example when rotate or it’s marked as needing layout. It’s the first step where the view bounds are final. If you are not using autoresizing masks or constraints and the view size changes you probably want to update the subviews here.

**viewDidLayoutSubviews**  
> Make additional changes here after the view lays out its subviews.

**viewDidAppear:**  
> Good place to perform additional tasks associated with **presenting the view** like animations. This method is executed after the animation displaying the view finishes so in this step **the view is already visible** for the user. In some cases can be a good place to load data from core data and present it in the view or to start requesting data from a server.


### UITableViewController  
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewController_Class/  
> The UITableViewController class creates a controller object that manages a table view.

### UITableView  
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableView_Class/  
> An instance of UITableView (or simply, a table view) is a means for displaying and editing hierarchical lists of information.
