* How do you create a timer?

### SEL
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Selector.html

> A selector is the name used to *select a method to execute for an object*, or the unique identifier that replaces the name when the source code is compiled. A selector by itself doesnâ€™t do anything. It simply identifies a method.

**What does this look like?**
```objective-c
SEL aSelector = @selector(methodName);
```

**What does this really look like?**
```objective-c
[self.button addTarget:self action:@selector(didTapButton:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
```
or 
```objective-c
[self performSelector:@selector(nameOfMyMethod) withObject:self];
```

### NSTimer
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSTimer_Class/

> You use the NSTimer class to create timer objects or, more simply, timers. A timer waits until a certain time interval has elapsed and then fires, sending a specified message to a target object.
```objective-c
NSTimer *timer = [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval:1.0 target:self selector:@selector(captureTimerFired:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO];
```
