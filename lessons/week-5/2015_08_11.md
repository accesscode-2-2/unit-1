# Objectives 
* UINavigationControllers
* Data structure

### UINavigationController

* Implemented as a stack

#### What is a stack?
> **A stack** is a commonly used data structure that works on the principle of “last in, first out.

* **Concrete Example:** Pez Dispenser 
  * Last piece of candy that goes in is the first to come out.  
  * [Pez in Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCx_dBWzsgE)

* The stack data structure works the same way:
  * When you add an object to the stack , its called a *push*. You push an object onto the stack.
  * The first object that you push onto the stack is called the base of the stack.
  * The last object that you pushed on the stack is called the top of the stack (until it is replaced by the next object you push on the stack.)
  * When you remove an object from the stack, it’s called a *pop*. When you pop an object off the stack, it’s always the last one you pushed on the stack. Conversely, the first object you push onto the stack will always be the last one you pop off the stack.

* A navigation controller maintains a stack of view controllers.
* Base of Stack is the Root View Controller
* Subsequent View Controllers are called Subcontrollers
