# Objectives
* Data organization

### Exercises
> **Planets!!!!**
> * Create a new Xcode project. Call it Planets.
> * First, let's set up our interface
>    * 1 `UINavigationController` and 2 `UIViewController`
>    * The *root view controller* of the `UINavigationController` should have a class of `ViewController`.
>    * The other `UIViewController` should have a class of `PlanetViewController` (you'll need to create a new class, a subclass of `UIViewController`)
>    * `ViewController` should have 1 `UILabel` and 1 `UIButton`
>    * `PlanetViewController` should have `UILabel`
>    * Make sure that the `UINavigationController` is the initial view controller.

> * Create an *action* from the button in `ViewController` to the `implementation` in `ViewController.m`
> * Create a *property* called *planetNameLabel* in `PlanetViewController.m`. Make sure it's hooked up to the storyboard.

**STOP!**   
Make sure you understand everything that just happend. IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ASK SOMEONE!

> * Next, let's set up our interaction 
> * In `ViewController.m`, create an action when the button is tapped
> * Inside of your new action, initialize a new instance of `PlanetViewController` (don't forget to import the .h)
>   * The following code is boilerplate. Please read it and understand what it's doing. Copying and pasting will not work :)
>   * https://gist.github.com/mikekavouras/e663417c18d0e7165642
> * Run the app. When you tap the button it should navigate to the other view controller

**STOP!**   
Make sure you understand everything that just happend. IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ASK SOMEONE!

> * Next, let's set up the data
> * In `ViewController.m` create a `property` of type `NSMutableArray` called *planets*
> * In `ViewController.m` create new instance method called `setupPlanetData`. The return type is void and there are 0 parameters
> * Inside of `setupPlanetData`, initialize the `planets` property.
> * Create an `NSMutableDictionary` with the following keys and values
>   * `@"name" : @"Saturn"`
>   * `@"orbitalSpeed" : @(9.69)`
>   * `@"axisTilt" : @(26.73)`
> * Add the dictionary to the array
> * In `viewDidLoad`, call `[self setupPlanetData]`
> * Set a breakpoint after you call `[self setupPlanetData]` and inspect the values. If something is wrong, try to figure out how to fix it

**STOP!**   
Make sure you understand everything that just happend. IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ASK SOMEONE!

> * In `PlanetViewController.h` create a `property` of type `NSMutableDicationary` called *planet*
> * In the `viewDidLoad` method in `PlanetViewController.m`, set the text property of the `planetNameLabel` property to `[planet objectForKey:@"name"]`

**STOP!**   
Make sure you understand everything that just happend. IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ASK SOMEONE!

> * In `ViewController.m`, inside of your IBAction (the action for your button), set the `planet` property of the `PlanetViewController` to be `self.planets[0]`, the first object in the `self.planets` property.
> * Run your app. Is it working? If no, set some breakpoints and add some NSLogs until you find out what's 

**Next Steps**
> * Add a few more labels to `PlanetViewController` so that you can display the *orbitalSpeed* and the *axisTilt*
> * REFACTOR THE CODE TO USE A PLANET CLASS INSTEAD OF NSDICTIONARY

**Next Next Steps**
> * Change `ViewController` to a table that displays all of the planets in your *planets* property.
> * Pass information to `PlanetViewController` either by using the `UITableViewDelegate` `didSelectRowAtIndexPath:` method or `prepareForSegue`

**BONUS** 
Do the exercise above in Swift
