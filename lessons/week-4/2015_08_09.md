### Exercises
> **UIAlertView**  
> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-sdk-working-with-uialertview-and-uialertviewdelegate--mobile-3159  
> * In `viewDidLoad`, create and show a `UIAlertView`. 
> * Make sure your view controller *conforms to the [UIAlertViewDelegate protocol](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAlertViewDelegate_Protocol/index.html)*  
> * Implement some UIAlertViewDelegate methods with NSLogs  

> **UIAlertViewController**  
> As of iOS 8, Apple introduced a new way to handle alerts, `UIAlertController`.
> * Create another alert using `UIAlertController`
> Notice that there is no delegate for `UIAlertController`. What are some pros a cons to the new approach? 

> **UIPickerView**
https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIPickerViewDelegate_Protocol/index.html
> * Add a `UIPickerView` to your storyboard.  
> * Drag from your `UIPickerView` into your code, creating a `property` in your view controller.  
> * In `viewDidLoad`, set the `delegate` property of the `UIPickerView` to be `self` (the view controller)  
> * In `viewDidLoad`, set the `dataSource` property to be `self` (the view controller)  
> * Make sure that your view controller class *conforms to the `UIPickerViewDelegate` protocol and the `UIPickerViewDataSource` protocol. (`<UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource>`)
> * Implement the required methods to render and interact with the `UIPickerView`  
> * **Fun ensues**  

> **Roll your own**
