* How to look up keys to get values.


## NSDictionary / NSMutableDictionary
The NSDictionary class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage immutable associations of keys and values... A key-value pair within a dictionary is called an entry. Each entry consists of one object that represents the key and a second object that is that key’s value. Within a dictionary, the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary are equal.

> Create an NSDictionary containing your name (NSString*), your age (NSString*), and your height (NSString*)
```objective-c
NSDictionary *mike = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"mike", @"name", @26, @"age", @68, @"height", nil];
```
or
```objective-c
NSArray *objects = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"mike", @26, @68, nil];
NSArray *keys = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"name", @"age", @"height", nil];
NSDictionary *mike = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjects:objects forKeys:keys];
```
or 
```objective-c
NSDictionary *mike = @{
  @"name"   : @"mike",
  @"age"    : @26,
  @"height" : @68
};
```
> Print the NSDictionary
```objective-c
NSLog(@"%@", mike);
```


### Exercises

**Cities/States**

> Create an NSDictionary of states (key: state name, value: state abbr)  
```objective-c

```

Create an NSDictionary of cities (key: state abbr, value: city name)
Add a few more cities (setValueForKey:)
Print out some cities
Print out some states
Enumerate through states dictionary, print out key + value
Enumerate cities dictionary, print out key + value
Enumerate states, print out state and corresponding city
try states[“name”] vs. [states valueForKey:”name”]

The above exercise was originally written in Python, taken from http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html.
