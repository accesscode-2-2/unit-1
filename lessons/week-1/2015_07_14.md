## NSDictionary / NSMutableDictionary
The NSDictionary class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage immutable associations of keys and values... A key-value pair within a dictionary is called an entry. Each entry consists of one object that represents the key and a second object that is that keyâ€™s value. Within a dictionary, the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary are equal.

### Exercises

> Create an NSDictionary containing your name (NSString*), your age (NSString*), and your height (NSString*)
```objective-c
NSDictionary *mike = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@"mike", @"name", @26, @"age", @68, @"height", nil];
```
or
```objective-c
NSArray *objects = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"mike", @26, @68, nil];
NSArray *keys = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"name", @"age", @"height", nil];
NSDictionary *mike = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjects:objects forKeys:keys];
```
or 
```objective-c
NSDictionary *mike = @{
  @"name"   : @"mike",
  @"age"    : @26,
  @"height" : @68
};
```
> Print the NSDictionary
```objective-c
NSLog(@"%@", mike);
/*
2015-07-14 13:10:40.643 Dictionaries[30728:4723092] {
    age = 26;
    height = 68;
    name = mike;
}
*/
```

> Print the object for the key "name"
```objective-c
NSString *name = [mike objectForKey:@"name"];
NSLog(@"%@", name);
```

> Print the object for the key "age"
> Recreate the above dictionary as an NSMutableDictionary
> Add an entry for "favorite_color"
> Add an entry for "celebrity_crush"


**Cities/States**

The following exercise was originally written in Python, taken from http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html.

> Create an NSMutableDictionary of states (key: state name, value: state abbr)  

> Create an NSMutableDictionary of cities (key: state abbr, value: city name)  

> Add two more cities (```setObject:ForKey:```)  

> Print out some cities  

> Print out some states  

> Print out some cities through the states dictionary

> Print every state abbreviation (enumeration)

> Print every city in state (enumeration)

> Do both at the same time using the common state abbreviation

> What happens if you try to access a key that doesn't exist? (@"texas");

> Does ```dict[@"key"]``` produce different results from ```[dict valueForKey:@"key"]``` ?

#### Bonus

> Do the exercises above in Swift
