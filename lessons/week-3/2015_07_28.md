## UINavigationController

The best way to think about `UINavigationController` is a *wrapper* around UIViewControllers. The job of a `UINavigationController` instance is to manage a group of `UIViewController` (or a subclass of `UIViewController`) instances. It simply does this by holding on to NSArray of `UIViewController` instances.

Because `UINavigationController` does not display its own view, it must *always* have at least on associated `UIViewController`.

`UINavigationController` also provides a `UINavigationBar` consisting of a `UINavigationItem` and `UINavigationBarButtonItem`. This allows a default place for navigation controls.
